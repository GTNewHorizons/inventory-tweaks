## What's this project about:

This is Inventory Tweaks for minecraft 1.7.10, but....  without this:

Yup.  all it does, other than a few minor bugs backported to mc 1.7.10 by @asiekierka, is add a config option to remove that pesky 'loaded' message.

It should be completely cross-compatible with other uses of inventory tweaks, both joining servers without this modification, and vice-versa. It has also been tested on servers.
